# MineSweeper 2.0

I originally made Minesweeper using P5 and electron. Since then I've learned
about github pages and want to make port my MineSweeper to its own website.
P5 will no longer work, so I'm remaking the whole game with HTML Canvas.


[You can play the game here](https://ahl96.github.io/Minesweeper/)

*This is a purely educational project*

## Things to add
- [ ] ability to change difficulty
- [ ] timer
- [ ] score board if possible, top 5
- [ ] button to start new game so the page does have to be reloaded
- [x] make board go red when player lost
- [x] make board go green when player won
